## Python Web Application Best Practices

In developing our Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow, we adhered to several best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability. Here are the key practices we applied:

1. **Use of Flask Framework:** We chose the Flask framework for its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for small to medium-sized applications.

2. **Modular Code:** We organized our code into separate functions and followed the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. This separation enhances code readability and maintainability.

3. **Comments and Documentation:** We provided comments and documentation throughout the code to explain the purpose of functions, routes, and complex logic. This helps other developers understand our codebase.

4. **Testing:** We conducted testing to ensure that the displayed time updates upon page refreshing. We manually tested the application by refreshing the page and validated that the time consistently updated.
