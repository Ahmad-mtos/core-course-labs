## Python Web Application Best Practices

In developing our Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow, we adhered to several best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability. Here are the key practices we applied:

1. **Use of Flask Framework:** The Flask framework was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for small to medium-sized applications.

2. **Modular Code:** The code was organized into separate functions, and the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern was followed to enhance code readability and maintainability.


3. **Comments and Documentation:** Comments and documentation were provided throughout the code to explain the purpose of functions, routes, and complex logic, thereby assisting other developers in understanding the codebase.

4. **Testing:** Testing was conducted to ensure that the displayed time updates upon page refreshing. The application was manually tested by refreshing the page to validate that the time consistently updated.

5. **Requirements File:** A `requirements.txt` file was created to list all project dependencies and their versions. This file can be used to recreate the virtual environment with the same package versions.
